                N=Float64, kwargs...)

Convert the given hybrid system objects into a concrete system type for each node,
and Julia expressions into SymEngine symbolic expressions.

### Input

- `HDict` -- raw dictionary of hybrid system objects
- `ST`    -- (optional, default: `ConstrainedLinearControlContinuousSystem`)
             assumption for the type of mathematical system for each mode
- `STD`   -- (optional, default: `ConstrainedLinearControlDiscreteSystem`)
              assumption for the type of mathematical system for the assignments and guards
- `N`     -- (optional, default: `Float64`) numeric type of the system's coefficients

### Output

The tuple `(modes, resetmaps)`.

### Notes

1) "Controlled" variables are interpreted as state variables (there is an ODE flow
    for them), otherwise these are interpreted as input variables (there is not an
    ODE for them).
2) If the system has nonlinearities, then some first order derivatives cannot
   be evaluated to numbers, and this function does not apply.Â In that case, you
   will see the error message: `ArgumentError: symbolic value cannot be
   evaluated to a numeric value`.
3) We assume that inequalities in invariants are of the form `ax <= b` or `ax >= b`,
   where `b` is a scalar value. Other combinations are NOT yet supported.
4) In inequalities, `x` is a vector of variables of two differens types only:
   either all of them are state variables, or all of them are input variables.
   Other combinations are not yet allowed.
5) Strict and non-strict inequalities are treated as being the same: both are
   mapped to half-spaces.
